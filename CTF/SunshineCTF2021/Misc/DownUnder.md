# DownUnder

*I mentioned to a friend of mine from Australia that I like the Game Boy Advance. Apparantly, they had a mysterious cartridge they found at a Men At Work concert, and they figured to send it me to figure out what's on it.*

*However, I have no clue why it keeps referencing a "flag." I ripped it already, but I can't figure out what it's about. Can you help me crack this code?*

题目中给出了一个`Gameboy`文件,放在[VisualBoxAdvance](https://github.com/visualboyadvance-m/visualboyadvance-m)里运行:

点击`Tools`->`Map Viewer`,勾选`Stretch to fit`,即可以在`Map`的底部看到flag

**flag:**`sun{n1ce_str1ngs_c0mm4nd_but_ch3cc_th3_m@p}`
